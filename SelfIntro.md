# Internships

Meituan:

CTrip:

**experience in Devops platform?**  
jenkins: link git repo to a jenkins project. run the testing case in the repo periodically by jenkins. We can see the result. If any errors occur, I can be informed and I will tell our developer to check.
CICD: when we push the code into the git branch, it will automatically trigger the testing. I can also manually trigger it if I would like to test some code. It can also help me to pack and deploy the package to maven repo.
